# Aventus Protocol 0.12.x Release Notes

This set of releases (see v0.11.x for the previous) allows events to be created and tickets to be (re)sold without any AVT.

The release notes for this version follow, listed by sub-release and category.

## Release 0.12.0 - 2019-01-21

- Events no longer require deposits and can no longer be challenged
- Combine Broker and Scaling Provider into new member type and event role: Validator
