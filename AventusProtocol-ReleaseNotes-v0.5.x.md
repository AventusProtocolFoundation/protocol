# Aventus Protocol 0.5.x Release Notes

This second public major point release (see v0.4.x for the first) represents the state of the protocol after the Solidified Audit.

The audit brought to light a number of issues, none of which were critical, that will be fixed over the next few releases.

The release notes for version 0.5.x follow, listed by sub-release and category, filtered by status.

Major changes:
* Updated all code to Solidity v0.4.24: enforced use of abi.encodePacked for all keccak256 calls.
* Split libraries into smaller, sub-libraries due to going over size limits when deploying

Minor changes:
* Fixed more notes from Solidified audit:
  * 14. Using constructors without the constructor keyword is deprecated
  * 15. Consider using latest version of solidity
  * 16. Replace wrongly made asserts and add error strings to require statements
  * 24. User correct ordering for modifiers and functions

Bug fixes:
* Fixed incorrect address usage in migrations file for library proxying

Efficiency improvements:

## Release 0.5.2 - 2018-06-05

Bug fixes:

Breaking changes:
* Challenge winnings distribution now uses the withdrawal pattern via a new method, claimVoterWinnings

Bug fixes:
* "internal" library methods have been replaced with "public" to fully enable proxying
* App deposits are now recorded, so changes to the fixedDepositAmount can not lead to loss of funds
* hashEventParameters() now pre-hashes two parameters to avoid problem with more than one variable length parameter. See http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/abi-spec.html#abi-packed-mode
* invalid "fund" parameters passed to withdraw or deposit methods are now checked with require, not assert

Efficiency improvements:
* Libraries now use constant bytes32 hashes where possible
* Voting options are now stored as a uint8 instead of a uint
