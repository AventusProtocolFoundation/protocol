Aventus Protocol 0.4.x Release Notes

This initial public release represents the foundation for everything that will come next; the building blocks to a new, more secure and easier to control way to supply and transact tickets. By developing an open standard that defines how tickets are managed and interacted with throughout the ticketing lifecycle, we can create a new paradigm and a new way to control bots, counterfeits and touting.

The Aventus Protocol provides a backbone of interoperability which will lower barriers to entry for developers in the ticketing industry. Developers can now access the Protocol via our API, giving them the tools to begin building (or expanding existing) ticketing applications and services to take advantage of the benefits of the blockchain. To this end, the full code is now available on GitHub for anyone to use.

The glossary and release notes for version 0.4.x follow, listed by sub-release and category, filtered by status.

Glossary
* Event Owner - Ethereum address that is stored as the owner of the event. Has all event-related permissions.
* Delegates - Other addresses that the owner has given permissions to sell and refund tickets.
* Apps - Ethereum addresses that can send messages to the blockchain on behalf of an event owner or delegate via a signed message on the blockchain. Apps need an app deposit to access the network.
